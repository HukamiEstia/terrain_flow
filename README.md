# terrain_flow **(WIP)**

The aim of this project is to serve as a personnal red thread to learn various domains of computer science (algorithmic, pattern design, parallel programming, data manipulation/visualisation...) by recreating the work described in [Interactive Example-Based Terrain Authoring with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320345887_Interactive_Example-Based_Terrain_Authoring_with_Conditional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks)
